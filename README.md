=====================================================
#1. Simple Notepad 
--------------------------------------
Notepad with save function only (save as SimpleNote.txt in \0\SimpleNotepad)  

#2. Simple DFS BFS Simulator  
--------------------------------------
Execute DFS or BFS at adjacency matrix and fill with '1'.  
You can save graph data and load data.(\0\DFSBFSSimulator\GraphData.txt)  
(input form: 0=can go, 2= start point, other character= can't go)  
  
  
TODO: add delay between step and step to show progression of BFS or DFS  
(Maybe use Coroutine?)
